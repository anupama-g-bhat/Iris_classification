# Iris Dataset Classification: Logistic Regression vs KNN  

This project compares **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classifying the Iris dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance of both models and analyze their accuracy.  

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Iris Dataset**, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  
- **Target (Species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)**
